From this workshop, I've learned a bunch of essential stuff. First, there's something called binary member operators, like `+=` and `-=`. These make it easy to do math with custom classes, and they're super useful. But, figuring out the exact way to write them was tricky at first. Then, there are type conversion operators. They help in converting custom class objects into different data types, which makes classes more flexible. But handling different data types can be a bit tricky. The workshop also introduced unary operators, which are like special tools for doing specific checks and tricks. Finally, there are helper operators that allow you to use regular numbers with custom classes.
